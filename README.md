# the-great-filter-toy-model

A simple interactive toy model to calculate the location of [the great filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter) given hypothetical new evidence of the discovery of alien life.

The model starts with a flat distribution (but others can be chosen) over twelve steps (planetary habitablity to galactic expansion) and a base chance of passing through each filter/step of 10%.

Depending on the parameters chosen, the discovery of primitive alien life could [increase](https://nickbostrom.com/papers/where-are-they/) or decrease the probability of the great filter being after us, giving us bad or good news for our future and our galactic aspirations.
